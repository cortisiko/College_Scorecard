# College_Scorecard
This is a simple web page which is aimed at providing guidance to high school seniors who are seeking the right college. This was done using frontend as well as backend languages such as HTML,CSS and PHP. Furthermore, The logo for the website was created using Photoshop.

This is a very simplistic approach to creating a website. A database was created using data from http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard

The process was done in three steps:

1- Created a HTML template
2- added CSS to display content
3- PHP was used to query the database.
